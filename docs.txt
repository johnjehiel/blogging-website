BUGS:
- tag buttons dont get highlighted when clicked for small tags

ERRORS:
- google auth isnt working
- banner image cannot take higher payload




FIXED BUGS AND REASONS:
1. going back to editor after clicking the x button in publish, the text editor doesnt show up i.e., its width is somehow set to 0
    reason: we didnt set the textEditor.isReady state back to false. so we set it to false when we save the text before publishing (blog-editor.component line:126)



Additional Features to implement:
- following and followers along with for you page and following page
- messaging - individual and groups (sending texts, images, videos, voice messages)
- blog communities (minor feature)
- ML implementation
    - tagging prediction from images or blog texts / tagging based on object detection / content moderation
    - recommendation systems (for you page)

    } catch (error) {
        return res.status(403).json({"error": "Banner Upload Error"})
