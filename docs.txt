BUGS:
- tag buttons dont get highlighted when clicked for small tags

ERRORS:
- google auth isnt working
- banner image cannot take higher payload




FIXED BUGS AND REASONS:
1. going back to editor after clicking the x button in publish, the text editor doesnt show up i.e., its width is somehow set to 0
    reason: we didnt set the textEditor.isReady state back to false. so we set it to false when we save the text before publishing (blog-editor.component line:126)
